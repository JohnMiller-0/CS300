# CS300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problems presented in this course involved algorithms that sort, present, and manipulate data read from CSV files.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structures impact the run time and memory allocated to be able to store and recall data. The structure chosen greatly impacts the syntax and the memory overhead of storing objects within a list.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Working diligently to understand the assignments and the code that goes into programming these different algorithms.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project showed me the value of writing modular reusable code. This project also enlightened me to the decision making process in designing  different data structure to fit different data types and business requirements.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project evolved the way I study algorithms and apply them to different programs to fit the business needs.
